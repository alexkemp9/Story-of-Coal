Steps to produce the Alphabetical Index:

1. index.txt was produced (contains *all* text within the booklet)
2. preconcordance.txt was produced from index.txt:
   $ cat index.txt | grep -o -E '\w+' | tr '[A-Z]' '[a-z]' | sort | uniq -c >preconcordance.txt
   # (a mistake was made: each line contained number-of-word<space> before each word)
3. using a concordance file requires making an *.sdi (text) file
4. index.sdi was produced from preconcordance.txt as follows:
   $ while read -r line; do read a b <<< "$line"; echo "$b;;;;0;0">>index.sdi; done < preconcordance.txt;
   # (the text ";;;;0;0" provides all-zeroed defaults for the rest of the line)
5. Using a sdi file whilst creating an Alphabetical Index will lead to a similar 'Edit dialog':

   (I never found the way to auto-save that file other than as explained at #4)
6. Pressing OK will then auto-search each Search term & place page-numbers in the Index
   (though there is no link available)
